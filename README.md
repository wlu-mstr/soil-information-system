soil-information-system
=======================

This is little toy of playing with java swing in Netbeans for a soil information management system.

Use mybatis as ORM and netbeans as IDE.

    class Soil {
      int id;
      double lng;
      double lat;  // Geo info
      double ph;    // PH value
      String timestamp;
    }
